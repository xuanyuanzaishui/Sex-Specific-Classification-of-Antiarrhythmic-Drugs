In this project, you can find the implementation of sex-specific classifiers for antiarrhythmic drugs, including relevant code and data.

The pipeline contains the implementation of male and female population data under AF and different drug conditions, which is implemented on matlab.

The table contains the raw feature data and means and variances of male and female populations under AF and different drug conditions.

The figurePlot contains the code used to plot the action potential traces and ionic conductance scaling value distribution of the population, and the images can be downloaded from Google Cloud Storage

In addition, due to storage limitations, the python code for building different classifiers and drawing other images is stored in Google Cloud Storage.

The experimental simulated population data is included in the TestPop folder, also stored in Google Cloud Storage.
